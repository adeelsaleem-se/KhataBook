# What is KhataBook?
KhataBook is an app developed to help in bookkeeping.
It maintains a record of transactions made in person and keeps all parties updated.
It is a simple application written in Java and uses Google Firebase.

# How does it work?
The app is pretty simple in its working. One user when logged in can create
a new transaction i.e they are now 'Sender' and have given hard-cash to another
user who are now 'Seceiver'. This is done based on their emails.
The receiver has control of approving the transaction i.e they agree with it.
The sender has control of marking the transaction paid, i.e they have received the cash back.
Hence a transaction represents one cycle of taking money and returning it.
